# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The goal of this analysis is to be able to compare the total fares per city type and analysis the increases and decreases in total fares collected from January to April of 2019.

- Suburban cities had a drop in fares collected at the beginning of April and started recovering at the end of the month.
- Rural cities had a spike in fares collected between March and April and got back to normal after that.

## Summary

### Recommendations
- The company should attract more drivers in rural and suburban cities. This would decrease the fare charged to customers, as a consequence, attract new customers into ride services.
- The company may revise the fares charged or create promotions in rural cities to attract more customers, since the gain of average fare per driver is considerably high, therefore, these changes would not significantly impact the drivers' earnings.
- There is a high number of drivers compared to the number of rides for urban cities, causing a considerable impact on the average fare per driver. It may cause demotivation in urban drivers, as a consequence, an impact on the quality of services provided. The company should consider increasing the fares charged in urban cities.
